# MetaHumans in Unreal Engine 5
In this document, I discuss an article from Unreal Engine's website [New release brings Mesh to MetaHuman to Unreal Engine, and much more!](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/new-release-brings-mesh-to-metahuman-to-unreal-engine-and-much-more) which talks about a new feature on the engine that allows users to create digital human models and bring them to life .

I found this feature on Unreal to be particularly interesting since this is the first time I saw a software allowing its users to have the capability of not just scanning a digital model of any human but going beyond that by adding character rigging, animation, and physics to that model as well. What this means is that any user can do so much more with their digital model by basically bringing it to life. Users first upload a mesh scan and then convert it into a "MetaHuman" using Unreal which adds detail and makes it look surprisingly close to a real human.

Users can then go on to edit the bodytype, hair, clothing, and so much more right within Unreal to create the MetaHuman of their choice. It's also amazing that the new MetaHuman plugin allows users to animate not only the body movements but also facial features so as to show expressions. I feel this new feature will open up a world of new possibilities, especially if virtual reality and the Metaverse start to become more integrated into our lives.
